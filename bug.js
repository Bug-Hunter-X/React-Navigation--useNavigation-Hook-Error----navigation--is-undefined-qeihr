This React Native code snippet attempts to access the `navigation` prop within a functional component before it has been properly injected by the React Navigation library.  This commonly occurs when using `useNavigation()` hook outside of a screen component wrapped with `navigationContainer`.

```javascript
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';

function MyComponent() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  // This will cause an error if navigation is not yet available
  navigation.navigate('Details');

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
